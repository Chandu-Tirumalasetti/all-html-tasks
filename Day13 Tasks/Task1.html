            <section><p>Sri Vasavi Kanyaka Paremswari & Dr.Kalidindi Suryanarayana Raju Arts & Science College(A), a pioneering educational institution in A.P. 
                was established on the august day of 4th August 1974 at Penugonda in west Godavari district under 'Sri Vaasavi Kanyaka Parameshwari Arts And Science
                College Association' with the highest guiding principle “Synoptic education to all”.  Behind this temple of learning strenuous efforts of several political
                and academic stalwarts have been there right from the foundation stone for the success and the growth of this institution in a big way.  It is highly
                apposite in this connection to mention in brief the need to establish the college and above all the way in which the founding fathers, floundered to give
                a concrete shape to their long cherished dream of establishing a college for the sake of the all round development of the youth in and around Penugonda.</p>
            <p>Prior to the founding of this Institution Parents of Penugonda, West Godavari district the rice bowl of Andhra Pradesh known for it’s mighty ever flowing 
                river,  the Godavari, the food giver of India and unique cultural values had to send their children to far off places for Pursuing U.G and P.G Courses.
                Both Parents and Students used to face several ordeals like transportation charges and exorbitant tuition fees etc.  So Parents relinquished the idea of sending
                their children for pursuance of further studies.   The future of the Students of this historically and culturally famous penugonda town was at stake, when it was
                at this crucial juncture some of the leading lights,  Pro bono public activists and above all Philanthropists joined their minds and might together and formed into
                an association called S.V.K.P. Arts & Science College Association and in Chorus the association made Sri Kotla Venkataramaiah as the founder president, keeping at 
                the back of their minds his committed selfless meritorious services he rendered.  Thus this college came in to existence and became an oasis to several students in
                and around West Godavari District.  In this connection it is quite germane to mention especially the name of the then local MLA Sri Vanka Satyanarayana a gentleman
                to the core in the field of malign politics, without whose combined contribution, the college would not have come to a reality.  The college has been aptly named
                after the Presiding deity of Penugonda, Sri Vasavi Kanyaka Parameswari and the name of Dr.Kalidindi Suryanarayana Raju was added to the main name later as a token
                of gratitude for his huge generous donation, he gladly made. Thus this college acquired the name of S.V.K.P. & Dr.K.S. Raju Arts & Science College.</p></section>
